# 🔳 QR Code Generator using Python

A simple and practical **QR Code Generator** built using Python.  
This project demonstrates how to generate QR codes from text or URLs using a Python library, implemented inside a Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and experimentation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This notebook allows users to generate QR codes by providing input data such as text, links, or any string.  
The generated QR code is saved as an image file, which can be scanned using any standard QR scanner.

The project is designed to introduce beginners to **external Python libraries**, **file generation**, and **real-world automation tasks**.
